Question 1 (List the symbols for each of the below Javascript operators)

* Arithmetic Operators
Addition = +
Subtraction = -
Multiplication = *
Exponential = **
Division = /
Modulus = %
Increment = ++
Decrement = --

* Assignment Operators
Equals sign (=)
Addition assignment (+=)
Multiply assignment (*=)

* Comparison Operators
Rational operators
Greater than (>)
greater than or equal to (>=)
less than (<)
less than or equal to (<=)

Strict Equality operators (===)
loose equality operator (==)
Not Equals operator (!==)


* Logical Operators
Logical AND (&&)
Logical OR (||)
Logical NOT (!)

* Bitwise Operators
bitwise AND (&)
bitwise inclusive OR (|)
bitwise exclusive OR (^)
left shift (<<)
right shift (>>)
bitwise NOT / unary (~)


Question 2 (For each JavaScript Operator, write 2 examples.)

let a = 10;
let b = 3;
let c = 6;

* Arithmetic Operators

Addition
console.log (a + b);
console.log (a + b + c);

Subtraction
console.log (a - b);
console.log (a - b - c);

Multiplication 
console.log (a * b);
console.log (a * b * c);

Exponential
console.log (a**b);
console.log (a - (b**c));

Division 
console.log (a / b);
console.log ((a + b) / c);

Modulus 
console.log (a % b);
console.log (a % b % c);

Increment = ++
console.log (a++);
console.log (++b);

Decrement = --
console.log (a--);
console.log (b--);


* Assignment Operators
Equals sign (=)
let a = 10;
let b = 3;

Addition assignment (+=)
a +=  10;
b +=  3;

Multiply assignment (*=)
a *= 10;
b *= 3;

* Comparison Operators
Rational operators 

Greater than (>)
console.log( a >  5); //retuns True

greater than or equal to (>=)
console.log( a >= 10); //returns True

less than (<)
console.log( a <  5); //retuns false

less than or equal to (<=)
console.log( a <= 10); //returns True

Strict Equality operators (===)
console.log(a === 10); //true

loose equality operator (==)

Not Equals operator (!==)
console.log(a !== 1); // false
